# Christmas Chutney
## Ingredients
- 750g cooking apples (peeled, cored and chopped small)
- 1 medium onion (peeled and roughly chopped)
- 500g fresh or frozen cranberries (thawed if frozen)
- 250g soft pitted dates (each date cut into 3)
- 2 clementines (or satsumas)
- 400g caster sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 500ml white wine vinegar
- 2 teaspoons Maldon salt (or 1 teaspoon table salt)

## Instructions
1. Sterilize your jars by washing them well in soapy water, then rinse them and let them dry in a cool (140ºC/gas mark 1/275ºC) oven. If you’re putting warm chutney into them, all jars must be warm. Or use dishwasher-clean jars fresh from the machine.
2. Put the cooking apples, onion, cranberries and dates into a large pan.
3. Zest the clementines/satsumas over the top, then squeeze in the juice and scrape in the pulp.
4. Add the sugar, ground cloves, ginger, cinnamon and cayenne pepper, then pour the vinegar over and sprinkle in the salt.
5. Now all you have to do is give a good stir, turn on the heat, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and let it bubble cheerfully, uncovered, for about an hour or until you have a pulpy mass.
6. Spoon into your warm, prepared jars and seal.
