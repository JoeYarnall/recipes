# Green Pasta
## Ingredients
- 2 shallots (minced)  
- 4 garlic cloves (sliced)  
- 1 red chili (halved, de-seeded, de-pithed, finely sliced)  
- 300g pasta quills  
- 100g tender-stem broccoli tips (chopped)  
- 100g runner beans (chopped)  
- 100g asparagus tips (chopped)  
- 150g of tangy thick dairy (creme fraiche, Greek yoghurt, or sour cream).  
- 1 lemon (juiced)  
- 1 veggie stock pot (recommend knorr stock pots)  
- salt and pepper to taste  
- Parmesan to taste  
- olive oil  
  
## Instructions  
1. Put the veggie stock pot and enough water to cook the pasta in a pan to boil.  
2. Mince the shallot, slice the garlic, chop the broccoli, runner beans, and asparagus into planks roughly the same size as the pasta quills.  
3. Once the stock comes to a boil add the pasta and cook to packet instructions, maybe a little under. Once done, remove the pasta from the stock and keep in a bowl. RESERVE the the stock in the pan and keep on a low simmer.  
4. Fry the shallots in a large pan with olive oil for 2-3m, until softened. Add the garlic and chili and fry for an additional 1-2m. Finally add all the green veg and fry for 2-3m.  
5. Add the stock to de-glaze the pan and reduce it down to a thick consistency. Turn down the heat and add the dairy to create a creamy thick sauce that will coat the pasta and veg.  
6. re-add the pasta and mix to combine.  
7. Balance flavour to taste by adding Parmesan/salt, pepper, lemon juice, or more dairy.  
8. Serve with Parmesan and black pepper on top.
