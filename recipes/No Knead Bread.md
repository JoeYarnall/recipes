## Ingredients 
- 430g bread flour (3.5cups) 
- 390g water (1.5c + 2tbs) 
- 12g salt (2tsp) 
- 1/4tsp yeast 
- Use high gluten (bread flour) for best results and that chewy crumb! 

## Instructions 
1. Mix everything together until there is no more visible flour 
- Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. 
- Ferment at room temperature for 12-18+hours (this loaf was 16hr) 
- After the time, wet your hands and stretch and fold in all the sides. 
- Move to parchment paper, seam side down. (this makes putting the bread in easier) 
- Proof for 2 hours (i use the same bowl to cover it) 
- Preheat your oven with your cast iron or dutch oven for 1 hour (450F) 
- Dust the of your loaf with a little flour and cut straight down the middle. 
- You can use a scissor for this part too. This lets the steam escape in a controlled manner. 
- Transfer your bread into your pan carefully.
- Bake Covered for 30 minutes. 
- Take the lid off and bake uncovered for 25-30minutes more. 
- Let it cool on a wire rack. Boom Bbby!!!! Nice job!! The key to the crust is to bake it longer than you think. Your oven is going to be dark so the bread will look darker than it actually is. I usually go the full 30minutes. For a funky sour flavor, let your dough cold ferment in the fridge for 3+ days. (after the initial 12-18hrs).
