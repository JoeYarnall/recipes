# Mediterranean Orzo Salad
## Ingredients
- 1 ½ cup dry orzo pasta
- 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 green onions, trimmed and chopped (both white and green parts)
- ½ green bell pepper, seeds removed, chopped
- 1 cup packed chopped fresh parsley, about 1 ½ ounces
- ½ cup packed chopped fresh dill, about 0.5 ounces
- ¼ cup sliced pitted kalamata olives, about 1 ounce
- 2 teaspoons capers
- Feta cheese, to your liking

### For the Dressing
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon oregano

## Instructions
1. Cook the orzo pasta according package instructions (mine took about 8 minutes). Drain and cool briefly.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the grape tomatoes, green onions, bell peppers, parsley, dill, olives and capers (hold the feta for now). Add the orzo pasta.
3. Make the dressing. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, lemon zest, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, oregano and a good pinch of kosher salt and black pepper. Whisk to combine.
4. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss until well combined and the orzo pasta is well coated with the dressing.
5. Top with pieces of creamy feta cheese. Cover and refrigerate for a bit before serving.
